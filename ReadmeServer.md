To run the server:
navigate to the loginbackend directory inside server folder, then run the following command:
  >> npm install

I'm also using Nodemon to monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server
To install nodemon use below command, or if you already have it then go to the next command 
  >> npm install -g nodemon

To start the server : 
  >> nodemon www start
